# Some possible questions to ask:
"""
    What are the rules of the game?
    What size is the grid?
    How many players are there? Player vs Computer? Player vs Player?
    Are we keeping track of the score?
"""

"""
    The game will be played by only two players, player vs player
    The game board should be of variable dimensions
    The target is to connect N discs in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally)
    N is a variable (e.g. connect 4, 5, 6, etc)
    There should be a score tracking system
    After a player reaches the target score, they are the winner
